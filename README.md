# Flood fill

## Statement
Replace all connected pixels of the same color with a new color. It's the "bucket" tool in many image editing programs: when the user clicks a point of the image, the old color is replaced by the new selected color.

## How to run
```
npm install
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```
